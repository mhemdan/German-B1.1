## Purpose
This project exists to facilitate effective German language learning at the B1.1 level through well-organized, structured learning materials. It addresses the challenge of memorizing and internalizing vocabulary, grammar rules, and language patterns required for intermediate German proficiency.

## Problems Solved
1. **Information Overload**: Breaks down complex language concepts into manageable, focused learning units
2. **Memory Challenges**: Structures content in formats optimized for memorization and spaced repetition
3. **Context Deficiency**: Provides real-world examples and context for vocabulary and grammar
4. **Learning Format Variety**: Offers multiple formats (CSV, MD) to support different learning styles and tools
5. **Organization Complexity**: Creates a consistent system for organizing language materials by lesson and concept

## User Experience Goals
1. **Clarity**: Present language concepts in clear, understandable formats
2. **Engagement**: Create materials that are visually appealing and engaging
3. **Memorability**: Structure content to maximize retention and recall
4. **Accessibility**: Make materials accessible across different devices and platforms
5. **Progression**: Support a clear learning progression through the B1.1 level

## Intended Workflow
1. Study materials organized by lesson (Lektion)
2. Review vocabulary using CSV files (importable to Anki)
3. Deep-dive into grammar concepts using specialized memorization files
4. Practice with example sentences and contexts
5. Track progress through the course material
