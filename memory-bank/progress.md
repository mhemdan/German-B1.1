# Progress

## What Works
- **File Organization**: Clear naming conventions and directory structure
- **Multiple Formats**: CSV files for Anki import and Markdown files for rich content
- **Grammar Memorization**: Detailed, engaging explanations with visual elements
- **Vocabulary Organization**: Semantic categorization enhances contextual learning
- **Learning Aids**: Memory tricks, mind maps, and practice exercises
- **Connection System**: Comprehensive system linking concepts across lessons
- **Visual Learning**: Mermaid diagrams for grammar and vocabulary relationships
- **Learning Pathways**: Structured routes based on different goals and learning styles

## What's Left to Build
- Materials for Lektion 3 and beyond
- Additional grammar memorization files for other lessons
- Consistency checks and quality assurance processes
- Potential audio components for pronunciation practice
- Advanced search and cross-referencing capabilities
- Expansion of the connection system for future lessons
- Interactive exercises leveraging the connection system
- User feedback mechanism for the connection system

## Current Status
- **Lektion 1**: 
  - Basic vocabulary in CSV format
  - Grammar memorization in MD format
  - Notion-memorization in MD format
- **Lektion 2**: 
  - Basic vocabulary in CSV format
  - Notion-friendly vocabulary in MD and CSV formats
  - Memorization-optimized vocabulary in MD format
  - Grammar memorization in MD format with visual elements
- **Lektion 3**:
  - Grammar memorization in MD format
  - Notion-memorization in MD format
- **Connection System**:
  - GermanConnections.md: Central hub with tagging system
  - GrammarProgression.md: Grammar concept progression visualization
  - VocabularyThemes.md: Thematic vocabulary organization
  - LearningPathways.md: Structured learning routes
  - GermanLearningHub.md: Central index for all connection files
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect connection system

## Known Issues
- Some inconsistencies may exist between different file formats
- CSV files may require formatting adjustments for optimal Anki import
- Some vocabulary entries may lack sufficient context or examples
- No standardized quality assurance process yet established
- Connection system will need regular updates as new lessons are added
- Mermaid diagrams may not render correctly in all Markdown viewers
