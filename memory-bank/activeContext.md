# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is focused on organizing and structuring German language learning materials for the Schritte B1.1 course, with a new emphasis on creating connections between concepts across different lessons. The materials are being prepared in multiple formats to support different learning approaches and tools, now enhanced with a comprehensive connection system.

## Recent Changes
- Created structured vocabulary lists for Lektion 1 and Lektion 2
- Developed grammar memorization materials for Lektion 2
- Established multiple file formats (CSV, Markdown) for different use cases
- Implemented semantic categorization for vocabulary in memorization-optimized files
- Added visual elements and memory aids to grammar explanations
- **Created a comprehensive connection system** with the following components:
  - GermanConnections.md: Central hub for all connections with tagging system
  - GrammarProgression.md: Focused view of grammar concept progression
  - VocabularyThemes.md: Thematic organization of vocabulary
  - LearningPathways.md: Structured learning routes based on goals and preferences
  - GermanLearningHub.md: Central index connecting all connection files

## Next Steps
1. Continue developing materials for subsequent lessons (Lektion 3 and beyond)
2. Enhance existing materials with additional examples and context
3. Create consistency checks to ensure uniform formatting across all files
4. Develop additional grammar memorization files for other lessons
5. Consider creating audio components for pronunciation practice
6. **Expand the connection system** as new lessons are added
7. **Develop practice exercises** that leverage the connection system
8. **Create specialized connection files** for specific aspects of German learning

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **File Format Strategy**: Using both CSV and Markdown to balance simplicity (for Anki import) with rich formatting (for study materials)
- **Content Organization**: Grouping vocabulary by semantic categories rather than alphabetically to enhance contextual learning
- **Visual Learning**: Incorporating emoji, tables, and code blocks to make materials more engaging and memorable
- **Grammar Connections**: Explicitly showing connections between grammar concepts across different proficiency levels (A1, A2, B1.1)
- **Learning Progression**: Structuring materials to build upon previously learned concepts
- **Connection System**: Using tags, mind maps, and cross-references to show relationships between concepts
- **Learning Pathways**: Providing multiple structured approaches based on different learning goals and styles
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Using flowcharts and mind maps to visualize connections between concepts

## Current Challenges
- Maintaining consistency across different file formats
- Balancing comprehensive coverage with focused, manageable learning units
- Ensuring all materials follow established patterns and conventions
- Creating engaging content that facilitates effective memorization
- Planning for scalability as more lessons are added
- **Keeping the connection system updated** as new materials are developed
- **Ensuring the connection system remains user-friendly** and doesn't become overwhelming

## Immediate Focus
- Complete documentation of existing materials
- Establish clear templates for future lesson materials
- Review current materials for consistency and completeness
- Prepare for development of Lektion 3 materials
- **Integrate the connection system** with future lesson development
- **Gather user feedback** on the connection system's effectiveness
