# Cline Rules for German Language Learning Project

## Project Patterns

### File Naming
- Always use the format `Lektion#[number]` as the base name
- Add suffixes to indicate special formats (e.g., `-Grammar-Memorization`, `-Notion`)
- Maintain consistent capitalization in filenames
- For connection system files, use descriptive names (e.g., `GermanConnections.md`, `VocabularyThemes.md`)

### Content Formatting
- Use emoji strategically to enhance engagement and visual learning
- Implement semantic categorization for vocabulary rather than alphabetical ordering
- Include both German and English examples for all vocabulary
- Use flag emoji (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) to visually distinguish between languages
- Structure grammar explanations with consistent sections (What is it?, How it works, Examples, etc.)
- Use Mermaid diagrams for visualizing connections between concepts

### CSV Formatting
- Use double quotes around fields containing commas or line breaks
- Use HTML `<br>` tags for line breaks within fields
- First column should contain German terms, second column English translations
- Include grammar information (gender, plural forms) with the term

### Markdown Formatting
- Use heading levels consistently (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Include code blocks for syntax patterns
- Use tables for organized reference information
- Implement emoji as visual markers and engagement elements
- Use bold and italic formatting strategically for emphasis

### Connection System
- Use tags to identify concepts by Lektion, level, and type
- Maintain consistent tag formatting (e.g., #Lektion1, #B1.1, #Verb)
- Include links to source files for all referenced concepts
- Use Mermaid diagrams for visualizing relationships
- Organize content by theme rather than by Lektion when appropriate
- Provide multiple learning pathways based on different goals and styles
- Keep the GermanLearningHub.md file updated as the central navigation point

## User Preferences

### Learning Approach
- Focus on contextual learning rather than rote memorization
- Provide memory tricks and mnemonics for complex concepts
- Connect new grammar concepts to previously learned material
- Include practical, everyday examples
- Use visual elements to enhance memorization
- Offer multiple learning pathways based on different learning styles
- Provide structured study plans for different time commitments

### Content Organization
- Group vocabulary by semantic categories
- Present grammar concepts with clear structure and progression
- Include practice exercises for active learning
- Provide "What I Can Do Now" sections for progress tracking
- Cross-reference related concepts
- Use tags to create connections between related items
- Organize content by theme across different Lektionen

## Technical Considerations

### Anki Integration
- Ensure CSV files are properly formatted for Anki import
- Consider adding tags for better organization in Anki
- Test imports before finalizing CSV files
- Include context in flashcards when possible

### Notion Integration
- Use Notion-friendly formatting for tables and content
- Ensure exported files maintain proper structure
- Consider Notion database properties for enhanced organization

### Mermaid Diagrams
- Use flowchart TD for hierarchical relationships
- Use mindmap for thematic groupings
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use consistent color schemes across diagrams
- Include text labels on connections to explain relationships
- Test diagrams in a Markdown previewer before committing

## German Language Specifics

### Grammar Notation
- Always include gender for nouns (der/die/das)
- Show plural forms for nouns
- For verbs, indicate past participle forms and auxiliary verbs
- For adjectives, note any irregular comparative/superlative forms
- For prepositions, note which case they require

### Example Sentences
- Use natural, contemporary German
- Include everyday situations and contexts
- Ensure examples demonstrate the specific grammar point or vocabulary usage
- Provide clear translations that capture meaning rather than literal translation

## Connection System Maintenance

### Adding New Content
- When adding new Lektionen, update all connection files
- Add new grammar concepts to GrammarProgression.md
- Add new vocabulary to appropriate themes in VocabularyThemes.md
- Update learning pathways in LearningPathways.md
- Add new tags to the tag index in GermanConnections.md

### Tagging System
- Use #Lektion[number] for lesson-specific content
- Use #A1, #A2, #B1.1 for proficiency levels
- Use #Noun, #Verb, #Adjective, etc. for word types
- Use #Conjunction, #Case, #Tense, etc. for grammar categories
- Use #Theme for vocabulary themes
- Maintain consistent tag formatting across all files

### Cross-Referencing
- Always include links to source files when referencing content
- Use relative links to ensure portability
- Provide bidirectional links where appropriate
- Update cross-references when content changes

### Visual Elements
- Maintain consistent color schemes across all diagrams
- Use the same style for similar types of diagrams
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on one concept
- Include legends or explanations for complex diagrams
- Test all diagrams in a Markdown previewer before committing
