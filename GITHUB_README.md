## 🛠️ Using This Repository

### Viewing the Materials

1. **Online**: Visit the [GitHub Pages website](https://yourusername.github.io/german-learning/) to view the materials in a web browser.
2. **Locally**: Clone the repository and open the HTML files in your browser.

### Converting Markdown to HTML

If you make changes to the Markdown files, you can convert them to HTML using the provided Python script:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install markdown
   ```
3. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   python convert_md_to_html.py
   ```

This will convert all Markdown files in the repository to HTML files with the same name and location. The original Markdown files will be preserved for reference and future editing, while the HTML files will be used for the GitHub Pages website.

**Note**: We maintain both formats because:
- Markdown files are easier to edit and maintain
- HTML files provide proper styling and color formatting for the website
- Having both allows users to choose their preferred format
