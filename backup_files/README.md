# Backup Files

This directory contains original files that have been moved here during the reorganization of the German learning materials. These files have been preserved for reference purposes but are no longer actively used in the main structure.

## Contents

This directory contains:

1. **Original Lektion#1 files**:
   - Lektion#1-Grammar-Memorization.md
   - Lektion#1-Notion-Memorization.md
   - Lektion#1.csv

2. **Original Lektion#2 files**:
   - Lektion#2-Grammar-Memorization.md
   - Lektion#2-Notion-Memorization.md
   - Lektion#2-Notion.csv
   - Lektion#2-Notion.md

   - Lektion#3-roleplay.md
   - Lektion#3-story-enhanced.md
   - Lektion#3-story.md

## Purpose

These files have been preserved for the following reasons:

1. **Historical reference**: To maintain a record of the original file structure
2. **Content reference**: In case any content from these files needs to be referenced or recovered
3. **Backup**: As a safety measure during the reorganization process

The content from these files has been incorporated into the structured lesson directories (Lektion#1/, Lektion#2/, Lektion#3/) in a more organized and consistent format.

## Note

If you need to access specific content from the original files, you can find it here. However, for learning purposes, it's recommended to use the structured materials in the main lesson directories, which provide a more consistent and comprehensive learning experience.
